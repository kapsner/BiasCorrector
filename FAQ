1) How need my input files to be formated?

	- For bias correction of type "One locus in many samples (e.g., pyrosequencing data)":

	  The first row contains the column-headers.
	  The first column contains all the sample IDs. Sample IDs may occure more than once if you have repeated measurements of the sample. In this case, the mean-values of the repeated measurements will be calculated for bias correction.
	  Columns 2 to x contain the results of your methylation analysis for each CpG-side of your sample.
