`BiasCorrector` is published in *'BiasCorrector: fast and accurate correction of all types of experimental biases in quantitative DNA methylation data derived by different technologies' (2021)* in the *International Journal of Cancer* (DOI: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33681](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33681)).

`BiasCorrector` is the user friendly implementation of the algorithms described by Moskalev et. al in their research article *'Correction of PCR-bias in quantitative DNA methylation studies by means of cubic polynomial regression'*, published 2011 in *Nucleic acids research, Oxford University Press* (DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr213](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr213)).  

## Installation  

### Using R 

- Make sure, you have R installed on your system:  
    
    + https://cran.r-project.org/  

- Then open your development environment and install this R package:

#### CRAN version

You can install `BiasCorrector` simply with via R's `install.packages` interface:

```r
install.packages("BiasCorrector")
```

#### Development version

If you want to use the latest development version, you can install the github version of `BiasCorrector` with:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kapsner/BiasCorrector")
```

- To start BiasCorrector, just run the following command in R. A browser tab should open displaying BiasCorrector. Alternatively you can type the URL "localhost:3838/" in your browser.

```r
library(BiasCorrector)
launch_app()
```

### Using Docker

To simplify installation an deployment of `BiasCorrector` you can clone this repository and build your own docker image. Make sure, you have Docker and docker-compose installed on your system.

#### Build Docker Image Manually

```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kapsner/BiasCorrector

# go to the docker subfolder
cd BiasCorrector/docker/

# run the build script
./build_image.sh

# when the building is finished, just start the container by running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

#### Using a Remote Docker Image

```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kapsner/BiasCorrector

# go to the docker subfolder
cd BiasCorrector/docker/

# start the Docker container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.remote.yml up -d
```

Type the URL "localhost:3838/" in your browser and start working with `BiasCorrector`. 

## rBiasCorrection

`BiasCorrector` depends on the `rBiasCorrection` R-package, which is the implementation of the core functionality to correct measurement biases in DNA methylation analyses. `BiasCorrector` brings this functionality to a user-friendly shiny web application.  
`rBiasCorrection` is available at [https://github.com/kapsner/rBiasCorrection](https://github.com/kapsner/rBiasCorrection). 

## Video Tutorial 

A video tutorial describing the workflow of how to use `BiasCorrector` in order to correct measurement bias in DNA methylation data is available [on youtube](https://youtu.be/xOf8uDbUrms). 

## Demo Version

A demo version of `BiasCorrector` is available [here](https://biascorrector.diz.uk-erlangen.de/).

## Frequently Asked Questions 

More detailed information on how to use the backend-package `rBiasCorrection` can be found in its [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rBiasCorrection/vignettes/rBiasCorrection_howto.html). The FAQs can be found [here](https://github.com/kapsner/rBiasCorrection/blob/master/FAQ.md).
