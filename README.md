BiasCorrector is the user friendly implementation of the algorithms described by Moskalev et. al in their research article *'Correction of PCR-bias in quantitative DNA methylation studies by means of cubic polynomial regression'*, published 2011 in *Nucleic acids research, Oxford University Press* (DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr213](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr213)).

## rBiasCorrection

`BiasCorrector` depends on the `rBiasCorrection` R-package, which is the implementation of the core functionality to correct measurment biases in DNA methylation analyses. `BiasCorrector` brings this functionality to a user-friendly shiny web application.

# Installation  

## Using R 

- Make sure, you have R installed on your system:  
    
    + https://cran.r-project.org/  

- Then open your environment and install this R package:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kapsner/BiasCorrector")
```

- To start BiasCorrector, just run the following command in R. A browser tab should open displaying BiasCorrector. Alternatively you can type the URL "localhost:3838/" in your browser.

```
library(BiasCorrector)
launch_app()
```

## Using Docker

To simplify installation an deployment of `BiasCorrector` you can clone this repository and build your own docker image. Make sure, you have Docker and docker-compose installed on your system.

### Build Docker Image Manually

```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kapsner/BiasCorrector

# go to the docker subfolder
cd BiasCorrector/docker/

# run the build script
./build_image.sh

# when the building is finished, just start the container by running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

### Using a Remote Docker Image

```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kapsner/BiasCorrector

# go to the docker subfolder
cd BiasCorrector/docker/

# start the Docker container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.remote.yml up -d
```

Type the URL "localhost:3838/" in your browser and start working with `BiasCorrector`.
